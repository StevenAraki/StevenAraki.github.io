                <p>This report examines the design of a Photovoltaic (PV) system using Panasonic EVERVOLT 370 Panels, string inverters, and microinverters for installation in Houghton, Michigan. The choice of Panasonic EVERVOLT 370 Panels is justified by their efficiency and reliability, while string inverters and microinverters are selected for scalability and performance optimization. The report transparently explains design steps, underlying assumptions, maintenance procedures, and financial aspects, providing a comprehensive understanding of the system's design, performance, and economic feasibility.</p>

                <strong>Modeling and Simulation of a Piston Pump using AutoLev Coding</strong> <a href="/assets/docs/Piston Pump Analysis.pdf" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>
                <p><span class="date">December 2023</span></p>
                <p>In this paper, we delve into the intricate mechanics of a piston-crankshaft system within an internal combustion engine, employing sophisticated techniques such as multibody modeling and virtual prototyping. Our focus lies on comprehensively analyzing the motion and dynamics of this crucial engine component, shedding light on its pivotal role in converting reciprocating motion to rotary motion. Through Autolev coding and advanced simulations, we aim to provide a detailed understanding of the behavior and performance of piston pumps. By combining theoretical analysis with practical insights, we contribute to the optimization of engine designs, ultimately enhancing efficiency and functionality.</p>

                <strong>Finite Element Analysis (FEA) of Body Armor</strong> <a href="/assets/docs/FEA_Final_Paper.pdf" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>
                <p><span class="date">April 2023</span></p>
                <p>This study examines three commonly used grades of body armor for law enforcement officers, aiming to compare their protective capabilities against ballistic threats. Testing involved various ammunition types and calibers. Results indicate that while all grades offer high protection, performance varies based on ammunition type and caliber. The findings offer valuable insights for law enforcement agencies in selecting and utilizing protective gear.</p>
