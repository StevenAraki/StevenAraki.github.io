    <p>Greetings! I am a undergrad student at <a href="https://www.stmartin.edu/" target="_blank">Saint Martin's University</a>. Currently pursuing a bachelors 
    in mechanical engineering, graduating in May 2024. Seeking a concentration in Intelligent, Dynamic Systems and Analysis.</p>

    <p>My journey in Mechanical Engineering began when my father worked for TRW Inc on the aerospace side and helped build satellites with them before they were bought out by Northrop Grumman. Since then, I have had a passion to work in the same field as my father.</p>

    <p>I firmly believe in the power of hard work, such as innovation, creativity, or integrity, and I aim to apply these principles in everything I do. My approach to Mechanical Engineering is characterized by that same passion to further our exploration of space.</p>

    <p>As a constant learner, I thrive on staying up to date with the latest trends, technologies, and best practices. I am a strong advocate for research and development for space exploration, and I endeavor to use my skills to make a positive impact in the aerospace community.</p>

    <p>Also, in my free time I love the outdoors, especially in Washington state. I love fishing/crabbing/clamming around here since I grew up learning how to fish from my father and mother. These activities not only provide balance but also serve as a source of inspiration and creativity.</p>

    <p>Thank you for visiting my professional portfolio. If you have any inquiries or potential collaborations in mind, please don't hesitate to reach out. I look forward to connecting and exploring the opportunities to work together.</p>
