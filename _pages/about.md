    <p>Greetings! I am a recent graduate of <a href="https://www.stmartin.edu/" target="_blank">Saint Martin's University</a> with a bachelor's 
    in mechanical engineering. During my studies, I concentrated on Intelligent, Dynamic Systems and Analysis.</p>

    <p>My journey into mechanical engineering was inspired early on by my father, who worked on satellites at TRW Inc. before it became part of Northrop Grumman. That exposure to aerospace technology sparked a lifelong passion to contribute to space exploration—one that continues to shape my career today.</p>

    <p>Currently, I serve as a Lead Test Technician at Blue Origin, where I support the testing and validation of New Glenn Valves in safety chambers and related systems. In this role, I lead efforts that ensure the integrity and performance of critical components for spaceflight, contributing directly to the future of aerospace innovation.</p>

    <p>I believe in the power of hard work, integrity, and curiosity to drive progress. My engineering approach is rooted in a hands-on mindset, constant learning, and a deep respect for precision and safety—especially in the high-stakes world of aerospace.</p>

    <p>Beyond work, I’m an avid outdoorsman based in Washington State. Whether I’m fishing, crabbing, or clamming, I find inspiration in the natural world and the traditions passed down by my parents. These experiences keep me grounded and fuel my creativity.</p>

    <p>Thank you for visiting my professional portfolio. If you're interested in collaboration or would like to connect, feel free to reach out—I’m always open to new ideas and opportunities.</p>
