                    <p> At Blue Origin, I currently serve as a Lead Test Technician II in the Safety Chambers group, where I support the development and verification of critical aerospace systems. My role centers around executing and leading test operations that involve gaseous nitrogen (GN₂), cryogenic fluids, helium, and hydraulic systems—all vital to ensuring the safety and functionality of flight hardware.</p>
                    <p> I work closely with cross-functional engineering teams to plan, conduct, and troubleshoot high-pressure and cryogenic test campaigns. This includes the setup, operation, and breakdown of complex ground support equipment (GSE), as well as the use of a wide range of calibrated instrumentation such as pressure transducers, thermocouples, RTDs, strain gauges, accelerometers, and flow meters.</p>
                    <p> I'm also experienced in reading and interpreting mechanical and electrical schematics, and I regularly interface with National Instruments software tools like LabVIEW and DeweSoft to support data acquisition and test automation.</p>
                    <p> Whether mentoring junior technicians or leading daily test operations, I strive to maintain high standards in safety, precision, and team collaboration. Every system we test plays a role in furthering human access to space—and it’s a mission I’m proud to be part of. </p>

                    <p>December 2024 – April 2025</p>
                    <p>Initially brought on as a Test Technician II, I performed valve and fluid systems testing using GN₂, LN₂, and helium in support of BE-4, BE-3, and BE-7 engines. I gained experience in ISO 7 cleanroom procedures, sensor configuration, and DAQ systems, and read P&IDs to set up test plans. My contributions to test cadence and mentorship helped earn my promotion to Lead.</p>

                    <p> I was part of a team that worked on a US Navy Contract building 12 of the 84' MK VI patrol boats, for the Naval Expeditionary Combat Command (NECC). My team worked in the engine room and pump room. Our job entailed getting of empty hull, from fabrication, and installing all components into the vessel. We would install the electrical components, walkways, insulation, and anything you can imagine that would need for the engine room, engines and jet pumps.</p>
                    <p> So I have a thorough understanding of 12V DC electrical systems, including terminating and basic troubleshooting. Ability to layout, build, and install subsystems from schematics, including development of part lists, ordering parts, assembling components, and testing to ABYC Standards. And strong communication skills, both active listening and relaying of information to others, while under a timeline for production.</p>

            <p>I served in the reserves with this Coastal Riverine Squadron 11 Bravo unit (now known as Maritime Expeditionary Security Squadron) based out of Bangor Washington. This is also part of NECC and served 4 years in this type of command. I was an Engineman Second Class and was qualified in Tactical Craft Engineer, which includes troubleshooting, basic damage control and diagnosing problems that arise on a Cummings QSB 6.7 and 6BTA 5.9 diesel engines on 34’ SeaArk Patrol boat. I would adjust, test, and perform other preventive maintenance on a ship’s engines, diesel generators and other auxiliary machinery.
            Also, repair or replace valves, pumps, heat exchangers, compressors, and hydraulic or pneumatic control devices.</p>
            <p> I also held certifications as Vetting team member, which was a team of sailors that would board vessels to inspect and vet it for clearance to be used in operations with any naval vessel. Also, I was certified in the Security Reaction Force - Basic, this is training for 8 weeks of force protection and basic armed sentry.</p>

            <p>But during the two deployments I helped conduct build-up, configuration, and break out of 125 precision-guided munitions, 100 air-launched missiles, and 35,000 rounds of 20MM ammunition in direct support of Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation New Dawn. I tested and inspected munitions, armament systems, and missile components. Also, when I was transferred to the USS Roosevelt I supervised 10 personnel in timely completion of all weapon magazines during ship overhaul to get her out of the ship yards.</p>
