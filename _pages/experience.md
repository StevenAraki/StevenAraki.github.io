                    <p> I was part of a team that worked on a US Navy Contract building 12 of the 84' MK VI patrol boats, for the Naval Expeditionary Combat Command (NECC). My team worked in the engineroom and pump room. Our job entailed getting of empty hull, from fabrication, and installing all components into the vessel. We would install the electrical components, walkways, insulation, and anything you can imagine that would need for the engine room, angines and jet pumps.</p>
                    <p> So I have a thorough understanding of 12V DC electrical systems, including terminating and basic troubleshooting. Ability to layout, build, and install subsystems from schematics, including development of part lists, ordering parts, assembling components, and testing to ABYC Standards. And strong communication skills, both active listening and relaying of information to others, while under a timeline for production.</p>

I was an Engineman Second Class and was a qualified in Tactical Craft Engineer, which includes troubleshooting, basic damage control and diagnosing problems that arise on a Cummings QSB 6.7 and 6BTA 5.9 diesel engines on 34’ SeaArk Patrol boat.

            Also, repair or replace valves, pumps, heat exchangers, compressors, and hydraulic or pneumatic control devices.</p>
            <p> I also held certfications as Vetting team member, which was a team of sailors that would board vessel to inspect and vett it for clearance to be used in operations with any naval vessel.

            <p>I served active duty as a Aviation Ordnanceman, in the four years serving I reached the rank of second class petty officer in my third year. I had made the last two combat deployments on the USS Enterprise. After the last deployment we decommissioned her and I was transfered to the USS Roosevelt CVN-71.</p>
            <p>But during the two deployments I helped conduct build-up, configuration, and break out of 125 precision-guided munitions, 100 air-launched missiles, and 35,000 rounds of 20MM ammunition in direct support of Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation New Dawn. I tested and inspected munitions, armament systems, and missile components. Also, when I was transferred to the USS roosevelt I supervised 10 personnel in timely completion of all weapon magazines during ship overhaul to get her out of the ship yards.</p>
